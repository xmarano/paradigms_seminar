# Rush 2 - Object-Oriented Programming in C

## 🌟 Overview
[Rush 2](https://intra.epitech.eu/module/2024/B-PDG-300/MAR-3-1/acti-659907/project/file/B-PDG-300_rush2.pdf) is an 🏫 Epitech project aimed at introducing 👩‍🎓 students to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts within the C programming language. Inspired by 📚 Axel-Tobias Schreiner's work, this project challenges participants to implement OOP principles such as 🔒 encapsulation, 🔨 constructors, ❌ destructors, and 🔄 generic algorithms. Mor info on the [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/6790b5872f85cf3d7d68aac1/ATTI38bab97b9912d27e0d95591a0c87682aAFFC17A8/rush-2)

The project consists of three main parts:
1. 📖 **Reading:** Understand OOP concepts.
2. 🎨 **Design:** Learn a proposed object design in C.
3. 💻 **Implementation:** Implement types, containers, and algorithms using this design.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- 🔒 **Encapsulation:** Protect data by using functions to interact with types.
- 🏗️ **Classes and Objects:** Define types with 🔨 constructors and ❌ destructors.
- 🧳 **Generic Containers:** Implement data structures capable of handling various object types.
- 🧭 **Iterators:** Navigate through containers abstractly.

## ⚙️ How to Build and Run Unitest
1. 📥 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpitechPromo2028/B-PDG-300-MAR-3-1-PDGRUSH2-leo.gregori.git
   cd B-PDG-300-MAR-3-1-PDGRUSH2-leo.gregori
   ```
2. 🛠️ Compile and Run the project:
   ```bash
    python3 test_unitaire.py
   ```

## ✨ Provided Features
- 🔨 **Object Construction and Destruction:**
  - `new()` and `delete()` manage object lifecycles.
- 📦 **Basic Types:**
  - Implementation of classes like `Player`, `Point`, and `Vertex`.
- 🗃️ **Containers:**
  - Array and List implementations, complete with iterators.
- ➕➖✖️➗ **Operations:**
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparisons for custom types.
